A web application using create-react-app. The app consumes data from ..........

Motivation

I created this project to teach myself React development. Agglomeration of industry is an interesting economic phenomenon and I thought that exploring this would challenge my React skills. 

The large majority of the React components and logic were written from scratch by me. I did not use existing component libraries because that forces me to both understand React more deeply and get as much practice as possible. 

Tech/Framework Used

MERN Stack
MongoDB
Express
React (create-react-app CLI)
Node
react-router-dom
axios
Amazon Web Services for hosting

Installation 
This project requires Node and NPM installed globally.

Clone the repository to a directory of your choosing: 

[repository link]

Navigate into city-jobs and install the necessary packages. 

### `$ npm install`

To start the app locally:

###  `$ npm start`

Additionally, this project also requires you to clone and run the server code from this repo to work properly.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

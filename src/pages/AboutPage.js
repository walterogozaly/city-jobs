        This project came about as a interesting way to develop my React skills
        and show some data I collected on relative city strengths. Agglomeration
        of industry is a very fascinating subject and it weaves its way into
        many conversations that the tech industry has. Any who have read stories
        during the pandemic that "San Francisco is dead" are familiar with the
        rampant speculation surrounding these industry hubs.
